Project Structure rules : 
1. The main package directory is `jarvis/` and contains all core logic.
2. Core logic is organized by functionality under subdirectories:
    - `core/`: Main application orchestration, AI integrations, monitoring, security.
    - `utils/`: Configuration, notification, and system information utilities.
    - `cli/`: Command-line interface logic and argument parsing.
3. The core modules are further split by responsibility:
    - `core/ai/` for individual AI model integrations.
    - `core/monitoring/` for network and process monitoring.
    - `core/security/` for security features such as scanning.
4. Utility modules (`utils/`) house shareable configuration, notification, and system info logic.
5. CLI modules (`cli/`) manage CLI entry, command dispatch, and argument parsing.
6. The `tests/` directory must mirror the main package structure for test modules.
7. All documentation except README and release notes must go in the `docs/` folder.
8. Build and install scripts are placed under `jarvis/scripts/` only.
9. Keep the legacy monolithic `jarvis/backup/scripts/jarvis.py` for backward compatibility, but new code must follow the modular structure.
10. File and module names should be short, lowercase, and use underscores for separation.
11. All new features must be placed in the relevant subpackage and not in the root of `jarvis/`.
12. No business logic or core functionality should be placed in `__init__.py` files; these are for imports and exports only.

Document Addition Rules: 
1. Add all the documents other than readme and release  notes to docs folder only

Scripts rules : 
1. Add all the scripts in the scripts folder only
