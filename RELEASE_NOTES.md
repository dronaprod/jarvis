### 🔍 Security Scanning Feature

#### Folder Scanning for Sensitive Files
Jarvis now includes a powerful security scanning feature that uses AI to identify sensitive files in your folders. This feature is available exclusively with the Drona model.

**What it detects:**
- API keys, tokens, passwords, and credentials
- Personal identifiable information (PII): SSN, credit cards, phone numbers, addresses
- Financial information: bank accounts, payment details
- Medical records and health information
- Confidential business data: trade secrets, proprietary code, client data
- Authentication credentials: usernames, passwords, private keys
- Database connection strings with credentials
- Environment variables with secrets
- Configuration files with sensitive data
- Source code with hardcoded secrets

**Usage:**
```bash
# Basic scan
jarvis -scan -f <folder_path> -m drona -b <bot_id>

# With bot ID from config
jarvis -scan -f ~/Documents/myproject -m drona
```

**Example:**
```bash
jarvis -scan -f ~/Documents/myproject -m drona -b my_bot_id
```

**How it works:**
1. **File Collection**: Recursively scans all files in the specified folder (skips hidden files/directories)
2. **Content Extraction**: For each file:
   - Extracts up to 10,000 characters
   - Structures content in markdown format with metadata
   - Includes file path, size, extension, and content
3. **AI Analysis**: Sends each file to Drona LLM for sensitivity analysis
4. **Categorization**: LLM categorizes files as:
   - `is_sensitive`: true or false
   - `sensitivity_level`: high, medium, low, or none
   - `reason`: Explanation of why the file is sensitive
   - `recommended_protection`: Specific protection recommendations
5. **Reporting**: Generates comprehensive report with all sensitive files

**Output Format:**
```

## 📋 Detailed Changes

### 🎤 Voice Command Support

#### Hands-Free Voice Commands
Jarvis now supports voice commands, allowing you to interact hands-free by speaking commands instead of typing.

**Features:**
- Wake word detection - Say "jarvis" followed by your command
- Continuous listening mode - Keeps listening for multiple commands
- Full agentic AI support - Voice commands use the same intelligent iteration system as text commands
- Automatic command output analysis - AI iterates through commands until complete
- Works with all AI models - Gemini, SLM, and Drona

**Usage:**
```bash
# Start voice command mode
jarvis -v

# Voice mode with specific model
jarvis -v -m gemini
jarvis -v -m slm
jarvis -v -m drona -b <bot_id>
```

**How it works:**
1. Start voice mode with `jarvis -v`
2. Say "jarvis" followed by your command
3. Example: "jarvis list files in this directory"
4. Example: "jarvis check if my CPU usage is normal"
5. Jarvis processes your command with full agentic AI support
6. The system automatically iterates through commands until complete
7. Say "quit" or press Ctrl+C to exit

**Example Voice Commands:**
- "jarvis list files in this directory"
- "jarvis check if my CPU usage is normal"
- "jarvis show me running processes"
- "jarvis what's my disk space?"
- "jarvis check memory usage"

**Technical Details:**
- Uses Google Speech Recognition (requires internet connection)
- Automatically adjusts for ambient noise
- Supports phrase time limit of 15 seconds per command
- Wake word: "jarvis" (case-insensitive)
- Command extraction: Everything after "jarvis" is treated as the command

**Requirements:**
- Microphone access
- Internet connection (for Google Speech Recognition)
- SpeechRecognition library (auto-installed)
- PyAudio library (auto-installed)
- PortAudio (install via `brew install portaudio` on macOS)

**Installation:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip3 install SpeechRecognition pyaudio --user --break-system-packages

# On macOS, install PortAudio first
brew install portaudio
```

**Agentic Flow:**
Voice commands use the same agentic iteration system as text commands:
- Commands marked as "intermediate" trigger automatic iteration
- Command outputs are sent back to the AI for analysis
- The AI continues iterating until it has enough information
- Final answers are provided as plain text responses

**Enhanced Agentic AI Improvements:**
- Improved prompt engineering to ensure analysis queries use "intermediate" commands
- Safety checks automatically convert "last" to "intermediate" for analysis queries
- Original user query is always preserved and included in iteration prompts
- Command sanitization prevents timeouts by converting interactive commands to non-interactive versions
- Better iteration flow with clear progress indicators

### 🖼️ Image Support

#### Image Query Feature
Jarvis now supports sending images with queries for visual analysis. This is particularly useful for:
- Analyzing screenshots
- Reading diagrams or charts

jarvis "your question" -m drona -b <bot-id>

# With bot ID from config
jarvis "your question" -m drona

# Interactive mode
jarvis -m drona -b <bot-id>
```

**Machine Context Sent:**
- System information (OS, release, machine type)
- CPU usage and frequency
- Memory usage and availability
- Disk usage and free space
- Load averages
- Running process count
- Current working directory
- IP address

**Configuration:**
```bash
# Configure bot ID
jarvis configure -m drona -b <bot-id>

# Configure API URL (optional, has default)
jarvis configure -m drona --url <server-url>

# Configure both
jarvis configure -m drona --url <server-url> -b <bot-id>
```

### 🔑 Configuration System

#### New `configure` Command

**Gemini Configuration:**
```bash
jarvis configure -m gemini --api-key <your-api-key> [-n <model-name>]
```
